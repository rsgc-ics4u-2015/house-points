# House Points

A system for tracking student house point accumulation at RSGC.

# Initial setup

Team members: here is my recommended approach to getting this repository organized.

1. Create a folder named **db**.
2. Place the MySQL Workbench file that has the database schema in the **db** folder.
3. Place a plain text SQL file (created using *Forward Engineer*) in the **db** folder. This file should create the database, the tables and relationships, and populate tables with any initial data that you have created.
4. Commit these changes and push to GitHub.
5. Have another team member pull the repository.
6. Have that team member follow the process of creating the database by using the 'source' command in the MySQL command line client.
7. Verify that the database creation works.
8. Have this team member add any files they have created (interface mockups, etc). Have them commit and push their work up to GitHub.
9. Have the next team member pull the repository and repeat the process until all files group members have created are under source control.
